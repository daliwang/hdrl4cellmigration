Data organization
The data collection contains seven sets of observational data extracted from 3D time-lapse images of seven C. elegans embryos. Every set of embryo data has a series of Comma Separated Values (CSV) text files that contain the nuclei information at each observational timepoint during embryogenesis.  

Data format: AceTree text file format [1]
Each row is a nuclei record
Each record has the following fields: (separated by commas)

Nuclei ID, validity, predecessor ID, successor 1 ID, successor 2 ID, X, Y, Z, diameter, lineage name, lineage marker 'weight', reporter intensity - Boyle Units, summed reporter intensity, voxels, placeholder for acetree name, SRI, global correction, local correction, blot correction, "crosstalk" correction, Intensity in Boyle Units = (summed intensity in nucleus) / (# of voxels in nucleus) * 1000

For example: 1, 1, 24, 45, -1, 178, 57, 5.2, 1, ABalpaaaaa, 6547, 37259, 6036, 162, , 37259, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
